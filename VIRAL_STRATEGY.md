• Accessibility

Here's how (and why I'm sharing the process) 🧵

## 🎯 Phase 2: Community Engagement (Week 1-2)

### **Reddit Strategy**

**r/webdev - "Roast My Portfolio"**

```
Title: Built my portfolio in 4 hours using AI. Roast it.

Post:
Neo-brutalist design, 5 hidden easter eggs, built with SPARC framework.

Before you say "it looks AI-generated" - yes, I know. That's the point.
I'm testing transparent AI-human collaboration.

What works? What doesn't? Would you hire me?

```

**r/programming - "Built a framework that cuts dev time by 75%"**

```
Title: SPARC: AI development framework that reduced my build times by 75%

Post:
After building 20+ client projects, I noticed the same patterns:
- Repetitive component boilerplate
- Similar documentation structures
- Predictable file organization

So I built SPARC - an orchestration system for AI-assisted development.

Not just "ChatGPT writes code". It's:
- Structured prompts
- Version control integration
- Quality gates
- Documentation automation

Open source. Live on GitHub. Built my portfolio with it in 4 hours.

Thoughts?

**r/cscareerquestions - Career Transition**

```
Title: 10 years restaurant management → AI Engineer (lessons learned)

Post:
Started as Taco Bell crew member at 17.
Became ops manager by 25.
Now: AI Engineer training LLMs and building production systems.

What I learned:
1. Systems thinking transfers everywhere
2. Operations experience = understanding production requirements
3. Self-teaching is viable (built portfolio + framework as proof)
4. Transparency > gatekeeping

Currently open to opportunities. Happy to answer questions about the transition.

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't spam** - Engage authentically
❌ **Don't oversell** - Let work speak for itself
❌ **Don't hide AI usage** - Transparency is your differentiator
❌ **Don't post everywhere at once** - Strategic timing matters
❌ **Don't ignore comments** - Engagement drives virality
❌ **Don't be defensive** - Handle criticism professionally

---

## ✅ Quick Wins (Do These Now)

1. **Update all social media bios** with portfolio link
2. **Pin tweet** about your portfolio/SPARC
3. **Update LinkedIn headline** to "AI Engineer | Building Production Systems | SPARC Framework Creator"
4. **Add "Hire Me" button** prominently on site
5. **Create OG image** (can use Canva)
6. **Write first Twitter thread** (draft it now)
7. **Set up Google Analytics** to track traffic
8. **Create GitHub social media preview** for SPARC repo

---

## 🎯 The Viral Formula

**What Makes Content Go Viral:**

1. ✅ **Controversy/Debate** (AI in development)
2. ✅ **Proof/Results** (4 hours, 75% faster)
3. ✅ **Transparency** (showing the process)
4. ✅ **Utility** (SPARC framework others can use)
5. ✅ **Story** (Taco Bell → AI Engineer)
6. ✅ **Visual Appeal** (neo-brutalist design)
7. ✅ **Engagement Hook** (easter eggs)

**Your Unique Angle:**
"The AI engineer who's transparent about using AI"

Most devs either:

- Hide AI usage (dishonest)
- Or only use AI (no skill)

You: Use AI + show your work = credibility + shareability
