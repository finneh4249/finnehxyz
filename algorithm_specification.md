<THINKING>
1. **DECOMPOSE & DEFINE:**
   - **Objective:** Update the data model for `src/data/projects.json` to include expanded narrative fields (`detailedDescription`, `challenges`, `outcomes`) and append a new high-priority project ("PoliCRM").
   - **Inputs:** Existing `projects.json` content, "PoliCRM" case study text.
   - **Outputs:** A rigorous JSON schema definition and the fully synthesized JSON payload containing all 12 projects.

2. **DATA STRUCTURES:**
   - **Schema Definition:**
     - `title`: String
     - `description`: String (Short summary)
     - `detailedDescription`: String (Long overview)
     - `challenges`: String (Problem statement, 1-2 paragraphs)
     - `outcomes`: String (Results/Impact, 1-2 paragraphs)
     - `technologies`: Array<String>
     - `tags`: Array<{name: String, badgeClass: String}>
     - `image`: String (Path)
     - `githubUrl`: String | Null
     - `liveDemoUrl`: String | Null
     - `date`: Number (Unix Timestamp)
     - `featured`: Boolean (Optional)

3. **ETHICAL & LOGIC REVIEW:**
   - **Bias Check:** The "PoliCRM" project involves political infrastructure. The description must remain technical and objective, focusing on the engineering achievement (scalability, automation, compliance) rather than political ideology.
   - **Data Integrity:** "Challenges" and "Outcomes" for existing projects must be inferred logically from their descriptions to maintain truthfulness without hallucinating non-existent features.

4. **FLOW CONSTRUCTION:**
   - **Step 1:** Define the new Schema.
   - **Step 2:** Construct the "PoliCRM" object from source text.
   - **Step 3:** Iterate through existing projects and synthesize `challenges` and `outcomes` based on available context.
   - **Step 4:** Assemble the final JSON array.

# Algorithm Specification: Projects Data Schema & Content Update

## 1. Rationale

The current `projects.json` structure lacks depth, providing only high-level summaries. To better showcase engineering capability, the schema is expanded to include `challenges` (problem solving) and `outcomes` (impact). Additionally, the "PoliCRM" project is added as a featured case study of rapid, high-stakes engineering.

## 2. Data Structure Definition

### 2.1 Project Interface

```typescript
interface Project {
  title: string;
  description: string; // Card summary
  detailedDescription: string; // Modal overview
  challenges: string; // Technical/Operational hurdles
  outcomes: string; // Measurable results & impact
  image: string;
  githubUrl: string | null;
  liveDemoUrl?: string | null;
  featured?: boolean;
  date: number; // Unix Timestamp
  technologies: string[];
  tags: Tag[];
}

interface Tag {
  name: string;
  badgeClass: string; // e.g., 'badge-primary', 'badge-secondary'
}
```

## 3. Logical Flow & Content Synthesis

### 3.1 PoliCRM Synthesis

- **Source:** "Building Production Political Infrastructure in 48 Hours"
- **Title:** PoliCRM
- **Challenges:** Extracted from "The Deadline Pressure" and "The Technical Gap". Focused on the VEC deadline, $640k risk, and bot verification hurdles.
- **Outcomes:** Extracted from "The Impact" and "By The Numbers". Focused on 100% processing, funding security, and self-healing architecture.

### 3.2 Existing Project Augmentation

- **Method:** For each project, the `challenges` and `outcomes` fields are deterministically generated by expanding the existing `description` and `detailedDescription` into problem/solution statements typical for the listed technologies.

### 3.3 Target Data Payload (JSON)

The following JSON block represents the **final, merged state** for `src/data/projects.json`.

```json
[
  {
    "title": "PoliCRM",
    "description": "Automated political compliance infrastructure built in 48 hours to verify 911 members against electoral rolls.",
    "detailedDescription": "Facing a critical regulatory deadline with potentially $640k in public funding at stake, the Fusion Party needed to verify the electoral enrollment status of 911 members within a tight timeframe. PoliCRM was architected, built, and deployed in under 48 hours, providing a unified 'source of truth' that programmatically interfaced with electoral tools while maintaining data privacy.",
    "challenges": "The party faced a strict deadline from the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC) to prove its membership numbers, with significant funding at stake. The existing process involved manual lookups or fragile scripts that could not handle the volume or the anti-bot measures of verification portals. Legacy systems were fragmented, lacking a unified source of truth required for programmatic verification.",
    "outcomes": "PoliCRM processed the entire database in a fraction of the time, running completely unattended overnight due to its self-healing automation daemon. It secured the party's eligibility for $640k in electoral funding and evolved from a rescue script into a stable, production-grade application for future member management.",
